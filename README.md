Pong Game (unity 2d)

Game Concept
The game rules should be very similar to the original Pong. The right player scores a point if the ball hits the left wall. The left player scores a point if the ball hits the right wall. If it hits the top or bottom wall then it bounces off. Each player will have a racket that can be moved up and down to hit back the ball.

Our rackets should have an influence on the ball's outgoing angle:
If the racket hits the ball at the top corner, then it should bounce off towards our top border.
If the racket hits the ball at the center, then it should bounce off towards the right, and not up or down at all.
If the racket hits the ball at the bottom corner, then it should bounce off towards our bottom border.
